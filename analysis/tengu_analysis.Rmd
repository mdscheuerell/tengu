# Background


# Data

The original data were provided to me by Tom Quinn on 16 June 2020 in the form of an MS Excel file titled `Tengu_derby_leaders through 2019 derby.xls`. I exported the one worksheet of interest (`data in kg`) as `~/data/tengu_derby_data.csv`.

```{r import_data}
## set data dir
datadir <- here::here("data")
## import raw data
raw_data <- readr::read_csv(file.path(datadir, "tengu_derby_data.csv"))
```

## Fishing effort

This dataset lacks the necessary detail to calculate a proper index of the catch per unit effort (CPUE) because effort is ill-defined. That is, although we know the total number of days per year the derby was open and the total number of anglers that participated per year, we don't know how many days *each* angler fished. Therefore, we assumed that each angler fished every day the derby was open, which is almost certainly an overestimate of the true effort, but we have no reason to believe there would be any systematic change over time.I
